# brandon.saunders.blog 🚀
This repository holds my blog publicly for all to see.

My intentions are to designate this place as a space 🔭 where I can share ideas and things I'm learning. It is my 
hope that what I share will help other developers 🧑🏿‍💻🧑‍💻🧑🏻‍💻👩🏽‍💻 in their journey via learning new technologies ⚙️ or 
preventing frustration 😡.

So stay tuned 🎶 for what I'm about to share 📤! 

You can use this as a template for your own blog, or you can follow the awesome guide I followed on the 
[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-07-19-creating-a-blog-with-gatsby/) site.
